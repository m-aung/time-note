# Time Pass Management App - Functional Specification

## Overview

The Time Pass Management App is designed to help users track and manage time pass requests from individuals such as children, partners, and pets. Users can monitor issued, active, and expired time passes, receive alerts for expiring passes, and analyze time pass trends over different periods.
